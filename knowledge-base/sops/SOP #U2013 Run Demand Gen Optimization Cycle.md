Domain: Upper Funnel
Pillar: 0

## Purpose

Structured optimization cycle for Demand Gen campaigns covering health, audiences, placements, creative, bidding progression, feed integration, and brand safety.

> ❓ **The big question:** Is this Demand Gen campaign progressing toward its targets, or are there issues holding it back?

Run bi-weekly for performance review (Phases 1-3, 5). Run monthly for all phases including creative refresh and structural changes.

---

## What this SOP is NOT

This SOP does **not:**

- Launch a new Demand Gen campaign (See: [SOP – Launch a Demand Gen Campaign](../sops/SOP – Launch a Demand Gen Campaign.md))
- Execute deep audience optimization across all campaign types (See: [SOP – Optimize Audience Performance](../sops/SOP – Optimize Audience Performance.md))
- Validate initial campaign configuration (See: [Demand Gen Campaign Health Checklist](../checklists/Demand Gen Campaign Health Checklist.md))

## When to run this SOP

- Demand Gen campaign has been live for 30+ days
- Bi-weekly or monthly performance review is due
- Performance is declining after initial learning period
- Before scaling budget on a Demand Gen campaign

---

## Before you start

> ⚠️ **Demand Gen operates on upper-funnel economics.** CPA of 1.5-2x Non-Branded Search tCPA is normal. ROAS of 50-70% of Non-Branded Search tROAS is expected. Use Google Ads as source of truth (not GA4).

### Required inputs

- Demand Gen campaign live for 30+ days
- Google Ads account access with previous cycle notes
- Demand Gen-specific KPI targets (not Search targets)

## Execution framework

| Phase | Purpose | Output |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Phase 1️⃣** | Health check | Pass/fail status |
| **Phase 2️⃣** | Audience spot-check | Audience actions or escalation |
| **Phase 3️⃣** | Placement and frequency | Channel balance verified |
| **Phase 4️⃣** | Creative optimization (monthly) | Fatigue assessed, refresh planned |
| **Phase 5️⃣** | Bidding optimization | Strategy maturity progressed |
| **Phase 6️⃣** | Feed integration (monthly, DPA only) | Feed health verified |

---

## Phase 1️⃣: Health check (5 min)

1. Run [Demand Gen Campaign Health Checklist](../checklists/Demand Gen Campaign Health Checklist.md)
2. If any critical area fails, fix in this priority order: Bidding > Audiences > Creative > Placements > Feed > Brand safety

**Verification:** All campaigns serving, conversion tracking active, no disapproved ads.

---

## Phase 2️⃣: Audience spot-check (10 min)

### 2.1 Audience CPA review

1. Navigate to Audiences, keywords, and content > Audiences
2. Review CPA/ROAS per audience segment

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| All audiences within 1.5x target | No action. Move to 2.2. |
| One audience CPA > 2x target with 50+ clicks | Pause or replace that audience. |
| Multiple audiences failing | Schedule [SOP – Optimize Audience Performance](../sops/SOP – Optimize Audience Performance.md). |

### 2.2 Lookalike reach check

Review current lookalike reach setting against performance:

| Current performance | Action |
|--------------------|--------|
| CPA on target, volume too low | Expand: Narrow → Balanced, or Balanced → Broad |
| CPA on target, volume sufficient | Hold current setting |
| CPA too high | Tighten reach OR replace seed audience with higher-quality list |

Allow 14+ days after any reach change before evaluating.

### 2.3 Optimized targeting check

For each ad group, check the "Total: Expansion and optimized targeting" row:

| Expanded CPA vs targeted CPA | Action |
|-------------------------------|--------|
| < 1.5x | Keep ON |
| 1.5-2x | Monitor 14+ more days |
| > 2x | Turn OFF |

### 2.4 Quick demographics check

Review CPA/ROAS across Age, Gender, Parental status, Household income.

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Group CPA > 2x campaign average with 50+ clicks | Flag for exclusion |
| "Unknown" > 20% of budget with CPA > 1.5x average | Flag for review (do not exclude without 30+ days of data) |

> ↪️ **Deep audience work.** For demographics optimization, combined segments, audience insights, and expansion testing: [SOP – Optimize Audience Performance](../sops/SOP – Optimize Audience Performance.md).

**Verification:** No audience CPA-broken (>2x target) without a plan. Expansion impact documented. Lookalike reach aligned with performance.

---

## Phase 3️⃣: Placement and frequency (5 min)

### 3.1 Channel distribution check

Segment by placement/channel. Check if any single channel consumes >75% of budget:

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Balanced distribution across YouTube/Discover/Gmail | No action |
| One channel >75% of budget with acceptable CPA | Acceptable if CPA is on target |
| One channel >75% of budget with CPA > 2x target | Create separate ad groups per channel to control allocation |
| Channel with zero conversions after 30+ days | Exclude via ad group structure |

> ⚠️ **Do not disable placements based on last-click CPA alone.** Check view-through conversion columns before deciding.

### 3.2 View-through assessment

| View-through % of total | Action |
|--------------------------|--------|
| <30% | Healthy. No action. |
| 30-60% | Flag for backend validation. |
| >60% | Shorten view-through window or exclude from bidding. |

### 3.3 Frequency check

Monitor frequency metrics. If frequency >5/week with declining CTR: expand audience size or refresh creative.

**Verification:** No channel consuming disproportionate budget with poor CPA. VTC reliance documented.

---

## Phase 4️⃣: Creative optimization (10 min, monthly only)

### 4.1 Fatigue detection

| Signal | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| CTR declining | 2+ consecutive weeks | Queue replacement creative |
| Frequency rising | >5 impressions/user per 7 days | Add new creative variants |
| CPA rising, audience stable | CPA up 20%+ over 14 days | Creative is the likely cause |

### 4.2 Refresh process

1. Identify fatigued assets by format (image/video)
2. Add new assets alongside existing ones (do not remove immediately)
3. Allow 14 days for new assets to gather data
4. Pause underperforming assets after replacements prove out

### 4.3 Creative testing

Test one variable at a time. Minimum 14-day test duration per variable:

| Test | What to compare |
|------|----------------|
| UGC vs polished | Engagement rate and CPA |
| Static image vs video | CTR and conversion rate |
| Offer-led vs problem-led | CPA and conversion volume |

**Verification:** No creative running 60+ days unchanged. Refresh plan documented if fatigue detected.

---

## Phase 5️⃣: Bidding optimization (5 min)

### 5.1 Maturity assessment

Check where the campaign sits on the bidding migration path:

| Stage | Current strategy | Move to | When |
|-------|-----------------|---------|------|
| Launch | Maximize Clicks | Maximize Conversions (no target) | 15+ conversions in 30 days |
| Learning | Maximize Conversions | tCPA or tROAS | 30+ conversions in 30 days, stable performance |
| Targeting | tCPA/tROAS | Tighter targets | 50+ conversions per ad group per 30 days |

> ⚠️ **Set initial targets at current performance.** When adding a tCPA or tROAS target, use actual 30-day average. Do not set aspirational targets at migration.

### 5.2 Target tightening

For campaigns on tCPA/tROAS: tighten in 5-10% increments with 14-day wait between adjustments. Maximum 20% tightening per cycle. If volume drops >30%, loosen by 5%.

**Verification:** Bid strategy matches campaign maturity. Target changes documented with rationale.

---

## Phase 6️⃣: Feed integration review (5 min, monthly, DPA only)

Skip this phase if the campaign does not use Dynamic Product Ads.

| Check | Verify |
|-------|--------|
| Feed status | Active, no errors in Merchant Center |
| Product count | Expected number approved |
| Disapprovals | <5% of products disapproved |
| Image quality | No placeholder or low-resolution images |
| Price accuracy | Prices match landing page |

**Verification:** Feed is active with <5% disapprovals.

---

## Phase 7️⃣: Brand safety (5 min, monthly only)

| Setting | Expected |
|---------|----------|
| Inventory type | Standard or Limited (never Expanded) |
| Content exclusions | Sensitive categories excluded |
| Digital content labels | DL-MA excluded at minimum |

Review "Where ads showed" for brand-inappropriate placements and add to exclusion list.

**Verification:** All brand safety settings match expected values.

## Common failures

| Failure | How to avoid |
|---------|--------------|
| Comparing to Search benchmarks | Set DG-specific targets from day one |
| Optimizing before 30 days | Calendar-block first review at day 30 |
| Changing too many variables at once | One major change per cycle |
| Ignoring view-through conversions | Always check VTC columns before disabling placements |
| Tightening bid targets too fast | Max 20% per cycle, 5-10% per step |
| Using GA4 as source of truth | Use Google Ads for Demand Gen metrics |
| Leaving optimized targeting ON without measuring | Check expansion row every cycle |
